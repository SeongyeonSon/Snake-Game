# Snake Game Extension – Web System Programming Assignment
Course: Web System Programming
Author: Seongyeon Son
Assignment: Implement and enhance a basic socket-based Snake game (Client/Server)

🎮 Description
This project builds upon the socket-based multiplayer Snake game code provided during class. I extended the existing base by implementing five additional features independently as part of the assignment:

✨ Added Features
1. Collision Detection:
Prevents the snake from passing through itself or others, ending the game on collision.
2. Persistent Food Rendering:
Ensures the number of food items remains constant throughout gameplay.
3. Snake Body Growth:
Snake grows longer when consuming food, with body segments rendered in real-time.
4. Scoreboard UI:
Displays current scores in a scoreboard format, inspired by Slither.io.
5. Boundary-Constrained Player Movement:
Ensures each client can only move within its own screen boundaries.

🧠 Tech Stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Socket.IO
- Node.js (for server side)

📁 Files Included
1. client.html – Main client-side code
2. server.js – Server-side logic
3. README.md

⚠️ Note
All additional features were implemented by myself, referencing in-class material and extending it through trial-and-error with the help of ChatGPT where needed.
